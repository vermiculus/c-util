#### preproc

preproc is intended to implement the system discussed under
`future plans` in the main README.

An example input is in examples/car.pc. examples/car.h is the output
of `scala Preproc < examples/car.pc > examples.car.h`, but first you
need to install scalac and run `scalac parser.scala`.

Currently, preproc generates some pretty ugly code. This can be fixed
with `indent`
